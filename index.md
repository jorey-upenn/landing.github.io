Authentication
You can authenticate in any order:
GitHub, then SSO
SSO, then GitHub

Click on the single sign on link: 

https://github.com/orgs/upenn/sso

OR

- go to your GitHub account, and add your @upenn.edu address
- go to the GitHub SSO link
- Sign in with your PennKey
- welcome to the org!
2FA
Enforced in Penn WebLogin for most PennKeys
Enforce for GitHub also? (Currently enabled, I vote we keep it)
2FA can be used with multiple apps (Duo, Google Authenticator, etc.) if you scan the barcode with each one during configuration: “Tip: To configure authentication via TOTP on multiple devices, during setup, scan the QR code using each device at the same time. If 2FA is already enabled and you want to add another device, you must re-configure 2FA from your security settings.”
